# Personal portfolio

Personal portfolio built with Astro Nano.

Astro Nano is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme.
Built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, no frameworks.

It was designed as an even more minimal theme than my popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere)
